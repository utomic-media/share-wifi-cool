## 😎 Share your WiFi at home with your friends the cool way.
No more searching for the passwords. Now you can easily create a qr code that allows everyone to connect to your network.

Simply scan the qr code with your smartphone and it connects automatically to the network without typing a password(required Android 10 and iOS 11).
