    other questions about personal data, please do not hesitate to contact us at any time.
  </p>
  <h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
  <p>
    You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the processing of your personal data is
    concerned. To do so, you may contact us at any time. The right to demand restriction of processing applies in the
    following cases:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived by us, we will usually need some time
      to verify this claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to demand that we
      restrict the processing of your personal data.</li>
    <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to demand the
      restriction of the processing of your data instead of demanding the eradication of this data.</li>
    <li>If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements,
      you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of its eradication.
    </li>
    <li>If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your rights and our rights will have to be weighed
      against each other. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to demand a
      restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data &ndash; with the exception of their archiving
    &ndash; may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements or to protect
    the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited by the European
    Union or a member state of the EU.
  </p>
  <h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
  <p>
    For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or inquiries
    you submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption program. You can
    recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser switches from
    &ldquo;http://&rdquo; to &ldquo;https://&rdquo; and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
  </p>
  <h2>4. Recording of data on this website</h2>
  <h3>Cookies</h3>
  <p>
    Our websites and pages use what the industry refers to as &ldquo;cookies.&rdquo; Cookies are small data packages that
    do not cause any damage to your device. They are either stored temporarily for the duration of a session (session
    cookies) or they are permanently archived on your device (permanent cookies). Session cookies are automatically
    deleted once you terminate your visit. Permanent cookies remain archived on your device until you actively delete
    them, or they are automatically eradicated by your web browser.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cookies can be issued by us (first-party cookies) or by third-party companies (so-called third-party cookies).
    Third-party cookies enable the integration of certain services of third-party companies into websites (e.g., cookies
    for handling payment services).
  </p>
  <p>
    Cookies have a variety of functions. Many cookies are technically essential since certain website functions would not
    work in the absence of these cookies (e.g., the shopping cart function or the display of videos). Other cookies may be
    used to analyze user behavior or for promotional purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cookies, which are required for the performance of electronic communication transactions, for the provision of
    certain functions you want to use (e.g., for the shopping cart function) or those that are necessary for the
    optimization (required cookies) of the website (e.g., cookies that provide measurable insights into the web audience),
    shall be stored on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, unless a different legal basis is cited. The operator of the
    website has a legitimate interest in the storage of required cookies to ensure the technically error-free and
    optimized provision of the operator&rsquo;s services. If your consent to the storage of the cookies and similar
    recognition technologies has been requested, the processing occurs exclusively on the basis of the consent obtained
    (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and &sect; 25 (1) TDDDG); this consent may be revoked at any time.
  </p>
  <p>
    You have the option to set up your browser in such a manner that you will be notified any time cookies are placed and
    to permit the acceptance of cookies only in specific cases. You may also exclude the acceptance of cookies in certain
    cases or in general or activate the delete-function for the automatic eradication of cookies when the browser closes.
    If cookies are deactivated, the functions of this website may be limited.
  </p>
  <p>
    Which cookies and services are used on this website can be found in this privacy policy.
  </p>
  <h3>Server log files</h3>
  <p>
    The provider of this website and its pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log
    files, which your browser communicates to us automatically. The information comprises:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The type and version of browser used</li>
    <li>The used operating system</li>
    <li>Referrer URL</li>
    <li>The hostname of the accessing computer</li>
    <li>The time of the server inquiry</li>
    <li>The IP address</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This data is not merged with other data sources.
  </p>
  <p>
    This data is recorded on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The operator of the website has a legitimate interest in the
    technically error free depiction and the optimization of the operator&rsquo;s website. In order to achieve this,
    server log files must be recorded.
  </p>
  <h2>5. Analysis tools and advertising</h2>
  <h3>Matomo</h3>
  <p>
    This website uses the open-source web analysis service Matomo.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through Matomo, we are able to collect and analyze data on the use of our website-by-website visitors. This enables
    us to find out, for instance, when which page views occurred and from which region they came. In addition, we collect
    various log files (e.g. IP address, referrer, browser, and operating system used) and can measure whether our website
    visitors perform certain actions (e.g. clicks, purchases, etc.).
  </p>
  <p>
    The use of this analysis tool is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the
    analysis of user patterns, in order to optimize the operator&rsquo;s web offerings and advertising. If appropriate
    consent has been obtained, the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and &sect; 25
    (1) TDDDG, insofar the consent includes the storage of cookies or the access to information in the user&rsquo;s end
    device (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TDDDG. This consent can be revoked at any time.
  </p>
  <h4>IP anonymization</h4>
  <p>
    For analysis with Matomo we use IP anonymization. Your IP address is shortened before the analysis, so that it is no
    longer clearly assignable to you.
  </p>
  <h4>Hosting</h4>
  <p>
    We host Matomo with the following third-party provider:
  </p>
  <p>
    netcup GmbH<br />
    Daimlerstra&szlig;e 25<br />
    D-76185 Karlsruhe
  </p>
  <h4>Data processing</h4>
  <p>
    We have concluded a data processing agreement (DPA) for the use of the above-mentioned service. This is a contract
    mandated by data privacy laws that guarantees that they process personal data of our website visitors only based on
    our instructions and in compliance with the GDPR.
